            <h3> Getting to our rafting base is easy! </h3>
            <p> From Calgary, simply take the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) west towards the majestic Canadian Rockies. After approximately 90 minutes, exit at the Highway 93 junction and head south, following the signs for Bow Valley Provincial Park. Our base is located just 10 minutes past the park entrance, nestled along the scenic banks of the Bow River. Look for our bright red sign on the left-hand side – you can’t miss it! Ample parking is available, and our friendly staff will be ready to greet you upon arrival. We recommend arriving at least 30 minutes before your scheduled trip to check in, get geared up, and receive a safety briefing. See you on the river!</p>
