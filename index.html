      <p>Hello! My name is Nikki Pilling and I am from Idaho. I enjoy art, traveling, and hiking. I have 5 siblings who also enjoy the same things and we do alot of trips to the mountains together. I started  college in Hawaii before leaving to go travel Europe and Central America for a few years and taking some time to decide what I wanted to study. After a few months of living in a new city I decided on Graphic Deisgn and Art being a path I wanted to pursure. I'm now taking online classes and working to save up and move back to Hawaii to pursure my education.  </p>
